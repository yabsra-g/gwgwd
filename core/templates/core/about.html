        <p>“Gather Wood, Gather Words” focuses on and then unfolds from the figure and gestures of gathering wood. The
            Sisyphean labors of country women in rural Morocco or Brazil or India who collect branches for their family
            cookstoves become a guiding image/movement and point of departure for exploring climate anxiety. The action
            of gathering branches and the figure of the fagot becomes an invitation to gather together practices,
            imaginations and disciplinary knowledge in new ways to understand human action and consciousness in the
            Anthropocene.</p>

        <p>Our project asks whether rather than commencing with a concept or hypothesis, focus on a particular movement

        <p>Gather Wood, Gather Words unfolds from the figure and gestures of gathering wood. It explores climate anxiety
            and disciplinary knowledge through tactile labor and intellectual practice.</p>
        <p>The project focuses on gathering and bundling, moving from forest to sown field to factories, tracing the
            Sisyphean labors of country women who collect branches for their family cookstoves.</p>
